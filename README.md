# meta_tourism

## What

This is the repository for the paper **Going the distance?---A meta-analysis of the deterring effect of distance in tourism** co-authored by Elisa Panzera and Henri L. F. de Groot. 

## Requirements

You need *R* and preferably *RStudio* to run this code (the latter is only needed for the internal file structure as it creates a project). Moreover, one needs to instal *Stan* to estimate the models by mcmcm.

## Contents

### Code

All code needed for output as produced in the paper (Tables and Figures). If you want to run all output consecutively you need to run *main.R*.

### Data

Main Data is to be found in *data_thomas.xlsx*. *read_data.R* transforms this to an R data file.

### Figures

Figures as can be produced by the code.

### Output

Statistical output (tables in *.tex* format). Estimations create here large *.RData* files.
